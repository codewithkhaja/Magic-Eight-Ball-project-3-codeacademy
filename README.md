# Magic-Eight-Ball-project-3.
Based on control flow! tool which is very powerfull. I have created a program using Java Script which can tell someone's fortune.
In this project I have build a Magic Eight Ball using control flow in JavaScript.
The user will input a random question, then our program will output a random fortune.
